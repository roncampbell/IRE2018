<code>R</code> is a powerful open-source programming and statistical language. Scientists, statisticians and, increasingly, journalists are using it to find answers in mountains of data. The language itself, known as "base R", can do quite a bit. But computer scientists have built more than 12,000 packages atop base R, vastly expanding its capabilities. As a result, people turn to R for everything from analyzing multi-year medical studies to preparing charts and drawing maps.
