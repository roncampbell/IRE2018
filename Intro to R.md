<code>R</code> is a powerful open-source programming and statistical language. Scientists, statisticians and, increasingly, journalists are using it to find answers in mountains of data. The language itself, known as "base R", can do quite a bit. But computer scientists have built more than 12,000 add-on tools or <code>packages</code> atop base R, vastly expanding its capabilities. As a result, people turn to R for everything from analyzing multi-year medical studies to preparing charts and drawing maps.

The most popular of these packages is actually a suite of about 20 tools known as the <code>tidyverse</code>. It was developed largely by Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at R Studio, the graphical user interface for R. The tidyverse includes tools for importing, manipulating, editing and visualizing data; we'll be using it extensively in this class.

Before we go further, let's cover a few rules of the road. As a programming language, R is very powerful. You can do a lot of work quickly. The tradeoff is a steep learning curve. While there usually are two or three (or more) ways to do the same task in R, there are an infinite number of ways to do it wrong. Spelling and capitalization are extremely important; the strictest copy editor you ever met was easy going compared with R.
